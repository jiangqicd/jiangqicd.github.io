I am a PhD student in Computer Science and Technology at Zhejiang University of Technology. I joined the [Data Visualization Group at Zhejiang University of Technology (ZjutVis)](https://zjutvis.org/) in 2019 under the supervision of Associate Professor [Guodao Sun](https://godoorsun.org/). My research interests lie in data visualization (VIS), natural language interface for visualization (NLI4VIS), and intelligent visualization (AI4VIS).
